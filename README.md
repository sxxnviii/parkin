Parkinson's disease detection system using python
This project aims to detect Parkinson's disease using a machine learning model based on a dataset of medical features. The system analyzes input data provided by users and predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's disease. It is developed with a Python-based backend that processes the data and a frontend interface that allows users to submit their data for analysis.
